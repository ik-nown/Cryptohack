Firstly, our team would like to express our gratitude for your prompt introduction to the field of Crypto. Although some of us may not pursue this field, your guidance and lessons were truly helpful regarding algorithms, Python, mathematics, and improving our teamwork skills.

This assignment was particularly challenging for our team as only one member, Nguyen Thi Quynh Anh, had prior knowledge of Crypto. However, with the support of the rest of our team, we were able to complete the assignment to the best of our ability. We hope that you are not disappointed with our submission.
